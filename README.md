Source of Data:
The dataset utilized in this project is derived from publicly available health databases. It includes
various features related to patient demographics and health metrics, which are critical for predicting
diabetes risk

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to predict diabetes risk
based on health metrics. By focusing on data-driven insights, we can empower healthcare providers
to make informed decisions, ultimately improving patient outcomes. Future work may involve
expanding the dataset, incorporating more features, and exploring advanced modelling techniques
to enhance prediction accuracy.
